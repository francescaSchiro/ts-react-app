This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## To set up the file: 
I followed the starter template set up following the steps described here. [TypeScript-React-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter) 

`create-react-app ts-react-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts`

[react-scripts-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts-ts) is a set of adjustments to take the standard create-react-app project pipeline and bring TypeScript into the mix.

## FIX

- currentDay in _sportListItems.tsx_
