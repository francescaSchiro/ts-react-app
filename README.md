This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## To set up the file: 

`create-react-app ts-react-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts`

[react-scripts-ts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts-ts) is a set of adjustments to take the standard create-react-app project pipeline and bring TypeScript into the mix.
